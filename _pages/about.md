# Knowing me is knowing you !

... Hi, my name is Stanley Katende

Iâ€™m interested working with the web programming languages used in both front-end and back-end technology stack.

I am a Web Developer in progress and upskilling myself with a new set of skills in demand within the software development field.  I have worked on multiple projects, and some which are already posted on this web site, and many more are just work-in-progress.

This website has projects which demonstrates my skills in web development technology stack which includes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

I have taken self-directed web programming tutorials from different online sources, and I will share my experience on the blog page.
